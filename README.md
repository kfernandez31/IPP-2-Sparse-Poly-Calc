# What is this?

What you see is a repository of my solution for task no. 2. of the [Individual Programming Project (pol. Indywidualny Projekt Programistyczny, IPP)](https://usosweb.mimuw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2%2Fprzedmioty%2FpokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=1000-222bIPP&lang=en) course offered by the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw (further referred to as "MIM UW") in the 2020/2021 summer semester.

# Brief description

The task was divided into three iterations. The aim of the first one was to create a library of operations on [sparse polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_polynomial). The second's one was to give access to the operations through a calculator-like interface. The third one expanded the calculator with polynomial composition, among other things.
